# 🗿 Yle Journalist Dashboard 🗿

Yo, welcome to the absolute GIGACHAD of data projects. This is a dashboard project that scrapes Yle journalist articles, stores the data, and gives you a clean way to explore it. Built to make analysis easy and insights obvious. As Mr. ChatGPT would say it: "no fluff".

We are analyzing who is actually cooking 🍳 and who is just posting Ls.

## 🥶 The Features (Straight Ws)

### 🔍 Web Scraping (Selenium + BS4)

The scraper handles Yle’s dynamic content, including “Show More” buttons, and pulls full article text automatically. 🤖

### 🗄️SQLite Database

Storing all the tea ☕. Titles, urls, full body text, keywords. No crumbs left behind. 😤

### 📊Streamlit Dashboard

The frontend is straight moggging like the big Goggins himself🗿 🤫🧏‍♂️

### 🪄 Auto Metadata Detection

Auto-detects the journalist's name and keywords from the HTML meta tags. Big brain energy. 🧠

## 🛠️ The Drip (Tech Stack)

Python 🐍: The GOAT language.

Selenium 🕸️: For those suss dynamic pages that try to hide the loot.

Streamlit 📊: Low code, high rizz.

SQLite 🗄️: Keeps the data secure, no leaky epstein file vibes.

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the drip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Scrape data:
python main.py # (Watch the bot go brrr)

# Launch the Dashboard:
streamlit run dashboard/app.py

# Enjoy
```

### 🔮 Future Plans

**Pseudo Stats:** Real analytics aren’t public, so these stats are vibes-only (unless I set up a backdoor while working at Yle 😈😈😈). jk, obviously

**AI / RAG Integration:** We finna hook this up to an LLM so you can chat with the database.

Status: Still cooking. 👨‍🍳 Vibes: Immaculate. ✨
